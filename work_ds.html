                    <p>Overview</p>
                    <p>The Design System Establishing Project was a crucial step in creating a cohesive and unified
                        design language for our company, enabling us to deliver more consistent and high-quality user
                        experiences across all of our products and services. Ultimately, this will lead to increased
                        customer satisfaction, loyalty, and business success for the bank.

                    <p>Goal</p>
                    <p>The goal is to establish a comprehensive design system that provides a cohesive and consistent
                        experience across all of the bank's digital products and services. This system should include a
                        set of guidelines, patterns, and reusable components that ensure visual and functional
                        consistency and improve the efficiency and speed of design and development.</p>

                    <p>Challenge</p>
                    <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Resistance to change: Banks are often known for their traditional and conservative approach
                            to design and branding. Introducing a new design system may face resistance from employees
                            who are accustomed to the existing brand guidelines.</li>
                        <li>Coordination and collaboration: Design systems often require coordination and collaboration
                            among various teams, including product teams, design teams, and engineering teams. In a
                            large organization like a bank, coordinating these teams and ensuring effective
                            collaboration can be a complex process. It is important to gather input and feedback from
                            different teams to arrive at the best and balanced solutions.</li>
                        <li>Integration with legacy systems: Banks often have complex legacy systems in place, which may
                            be challenging to integrate with a new design system. This may require additional
                            development resources and careful planning to ensure a smooth transition.</li>
                        <li>Regulatory compliance: Banks are subject to strict regulatory compliance requirements, which
                            may impact the design system. The design system needs to meet regulatory requirements and
                            ensure the security and privacy of customer data.</li>
                        <li>Accessibility: Banks must ensure that their digital products and services are accessible to
                            all customers, including those with disabilities. Design systems must take into account
                            accessibility standards and ensure that the user interface is designed to be accessible and
                            easy to use for everyone.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="project-items">
                    <p>What we do</p>
                    <p>We held a design system workshop and involved a wide range of stakeholders from various
                        departments to brainstorm and establish a set of design principles that aligned with the
                        company's image of "integrity, professional, and vibrant." In order to ensure that the resulting
                        design system would be cohesive and consistent, we made a point to refer back to these
                        principles whenever there were disagreements or challenges during the design process. By
                        checking to see whether potential solutions matched or deviated from our agreed-upon design
                        principles, we were able to maintain alignment and balance the needs and perspectives of all
                        stakeholders involved in the project.

                    <p>Outcome</p>
                    <p>By establishing a design system, the bank can improve the user experience, streamline internal
                        processes, reduce costs, and maintain brand consistency across all its digital channels.</p>
