                    <p>Background</p>
                    <p>During 2021-2022, the banking faced unprecedented challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As
                        lockdowns and social distancing measures significantly impacted the efficiency of physical
                        branches, there was an urgent need to adapt to the accelerating pace of digitalization.
                        <br><br>
                        This project aimed to redesign the online bank account opening process to enhance customer
                        satisfaction and accessibility. This was achieved by integrating online and offline experiences
                        throughout the account opening journey.

                    <p>Roal</p>
                    <p>As a UX/UI Designer in CI design team, my responsibilities encompassed
                        collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to gather insights, conceptualize design
                        solutions, and execute the creation of wireframes and prototypes tailored for optimal usabiliy.

                    <p>The goal was to integrate online and offline experiences, facilitating a seamless transition from
                        digital interactions to in-person appointments. Additionally, there was an effort to streamline
                        the process for customers, enabling them to open multiple accounts—from stocks and savings to
                        credit cards—via a unified and user-friendly interface.

                        stakeholders from various departments, including UX Reaserch team, managers from the digital
                        development team, stock department, credit card department, legal department, and others, to
                        gather requirements and insights. </p>

                    <p> Based on the research and Analysis,we identified the key touchpoints in the user journey,
                        from initial awareness to account activation. This involved understanding the various stages
                        users go through, including awareness, research, initiation, account opening, document
                        submission, verification, appointment scheduling, in-person appointments, account activation,
                        and feedback/support.For each touchpoint, we mapped out the actions users take and the emotions
                        they may experience. </p>

                        stakeholders to review and offer feedback on the proposed design. This user-flow and wireframe
                        underwent multiple iterations through feedback and testing to ensure it not only seamlessly
                        integrates online and offline experiences, with smooth transitions between digital interactions
                        and in-person appointments but also align with business goal and legal procedures.</p>

                    <p>To emulate the personal and conversational experience customers typically encounter in a physical
                        branch setting, we strived to recreate the warmth, engagement, and personalized attention that
                        customers receive when interacting with bank representatives face-to-face. To achieve this, we
                        focused on:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Conversational Tone: We adopted a friendly and conversational tone throughout the online
                            account opening process, using language that felt familiar and approachable to users.</li>
                        <li>Human Touchpoints: We integrated human touchpoints, such as personalized messages or
                            greetings, to create a sense of connection and engagement. These interactions guided users
                            seamlessly through each step of the process.</li>

                        recommendations, guidance, and support based on their input and behavior.</p>
                    <ul>

                            corresponding forms would vary depending on the items selected using the checkboxes.</li>

                    <p>Outcome</p>
                    <p>Following the proposal's acceptance by the product team, the new account opening process was
                        officially launched to the public in August 2022. The successful launch marked a significant
                        milestone in the project's journey towards improving customer experience and driving digital
                        transformation within the bank.The implementation of the revamped online bank account opening

                            the time and effort required for customers to open new accounts. This improvement

                        <li> Increased Engagement: The improved online account opening process led to a corresponding
