                    <p>The purpose of the <a href="https://hr.esunfhc.com/StaffAcquisition/hireexam/Index/" target="_blank">Official Recruitment Website</a> Redesign Project is to create a visually
                        appealing and user-friendly website that effectively communicate the company's brand and
                        culture, and attract top talent to apply for job opportunities. The project focused on enhancing
                        the user experience and streamlining the application process, making it easy for candidates to
                        learn about the company, search for job openings, and submit their applications. The goal is to
                        increase the volume and quality of job applications, and ultimately, to find the best fit for
                        the company and its employees.

                    <p>My Role</p>
                    <p>This project was designed and developed from Dec 2020 to Jan 2021. I worked on this project as a
                        Web Designer and Front-End Developor.</p>

                    <p>The Problem</p>
                    <p>The HR team reported high bounce rates and low job application rates on the company's old
                        recruitment website. Upon analyzing the report, I identified three key areas for improvement:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The action buttons were not prominently displayed and the page contained an overwhelming
                            amount of information, making it difficult for users to navigate and proceed with the
                            application process.
                        </li>
                        <li>The website's structure was confusing and the user flow was unclear, adding to the
                            frustration of potential job applicants.
                        </li>
                        <li>The outdated design of the website did not align with the company's core value of embracing
                            digital transformation.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <p>Competitor Analysis</p>
                    <p>I conducted competitive analysis to understand the best practices in candidate onboarding
                        processes. Through research of other job sites and recruitment websites of competing banks in
                        Taiwan, I discovered several key insights:
                    <ul>
                        <li>It's essential for candidates to have a clear understanding of a company's core values and
                            hiring process.</li>
                        <li>The onboarding process should be quick and straightforward.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <p>Design solutions</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>UX Design<br>I collaborated closely with the HR team to thoroughly analyze the existing job
                            application process and identify pain points for users. Through this analysis, I recommended
                            simplifying the hierarchy to only two levels and suggested that HR reserve important pieces
                            of information for job applicants. We then consolidated job category information, company
                            introduction, interview process, and Q&A into a unified, single page, which was designed to
                            be intuitive and streamlined. By redesigning the user flow and making it more
                            straightforward, we were able to reduce the number of steps required to apply for a job from
                            several steps to just three, which has resulted in a faster and more convenient process for
                            users.</li>

                        <li>UI Design<br>The updated website will feature a modern and innovative UI design that
                            incorporates illustrations and motion to create a friendly, youthful, and vibrant
                            atmosphere. The use of illustrations and motion will enhance the user experience and make
                            the website feel engaging and interactive, encouraging users to explore the site and learn
                            more about the company and its job opportunities. To ensure ease of use, clear and prominent
                            action buttons have been added throughout the site, guiding users towards their desired
                            action.</li>

                    <p>Outcome </p>
                    <p>The Redesign Official Recruitment Website was lunched on Feb 2021. The project resulted in a 40%
                        increase in the number of candidates applying for job openings, as the new website design made
                        it easier for potential candidates to find job opportunities and apply for them. The outcome of
                        it is a high-performing, visually appealing, and user-friendly recruitment website that meets
                        the needs of both the company and its potential candidates.
